This project explores the application of advanced data analytics to scrutinize bank loan data, aiming to discern patterns and insights within loan performance and associated risk factors. Leveraging SQL for comprehensive data extraction and employing both statistical and machine learning models, the study seeks to forecast loan defaults and evaluate risk more precisely. Additionally, it integrates visual dashboards to effectively communicate these insights, targeting enhancements in loan issuance decisions, risk management practices, and overall financial performance for banking institutions. The anticipated result is a suite of actionable strategies, derived from data-driven analyses, poised to elevate operational efficiencies and decision-making processes within the banking sector.

This project explores the application of advanced data analytics to scrutinize bank loan data, aiming to discern patterns and insights within loan performance and associated risk factors. Leveraging SQL for comprehensive data extraction and employing both statistical and machine learning models, the study seeks to forecast loan defaults and evaluate risk more precisely. Additionally, it integrates visual dashboards to effectively communicate these insights, targeting enhancements in loan issuance decisions, risk management practices, and overall financial performance for banking institutions. The anticipated result is a suite of actionable strategies, derived from data-driven analyses, poised to elevate operational efficiencies and decision-making processes within the banking sector.

In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance, we need to create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

In our Bank Loan Report project, we aim to visually represent critical loan-related metrics and trends using a variety of chart types. These charts will provide a clear and insightful view of our lending operations, facilitating data-driven decision-making and enabling us to gain valuable insights into various loan parameters. Below are the specific chart requirements:

In our Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently.
